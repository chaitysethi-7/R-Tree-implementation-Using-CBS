# R-Tree-implementation-Using-CBS
This project implements the Corner-Based Splitting (CBS) (2014), an improved node-splitting algorithm for the R-Trees(first introduced by Antonin Guttman in 1984).  Basic structures, a variety of helper and main functions to implement creation, insertion and appropriate adjustment of R-trees, for mapping spatial coordinates has been covered.
